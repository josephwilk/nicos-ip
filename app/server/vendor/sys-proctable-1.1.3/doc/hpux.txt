= Description
   sys-proctable

   A Ruby version of the 'ps' command.  This is a C extension, not parsed
   output.  For HP-UX, proc structs are grabbed via the pstat_getproc() call.

= Synopsis
   require 'sys/proctable'
   include Sys

   # Everything
   ProcTable.ps{ |p|
      puts p.pid.to_s
      puts p.comm
      ...
   }

   or

   # Return the results as an array of ProcTableStructs
   a = ProcTable.ps()
   a.each do |p|
      puts a.pid
      ...
   end

= Constants
VERSION
   Returns the current version number for this library (as a string).

= Class Methods
ProcTable.fields
   Returns an array of fields available on the current OS.

ProcTable.ps(pid=nil)
ProcTable.ps{ |s| ... }
   Returns a struct of type ProcTableStruct for every process in the proc
   table in block form.  Otherwise it returns an array of ProcTableStruct's.

   If a pid is provided then a single ProcTable struct is returned, or nil
   if the pid is not found.

= Supported fields
   You can view the supported fields with the "fields()" class method.

= Future Plans
   Have the flags field return a meaningful value.

= Notes
   The "comm" field isn't really part of the psinfo struct.  It is just a copy
   (i.e. is identical to) the "fname" field.  I added it to provide a degree
   of consistency between all of the platforms.  I will also make a point
   of adding it to any future platform releases.

= Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of.  Please log any bugs on the project page at
