# This is a cross-platform Ruby file to start the Erlang BEAM VM

# Set up some strings that Erlang cares about:
curr_dir = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))
root_dir = File.join curr_dir, "dist"
bin_dir = File.join root_dir, "bin"
emu = "beam"
prog_name = "erl"

# Store the strings in environment variables
ENV['EMU'] = emu
ENV['ROOTDIR'] = root_dir
ENV['BINDIR'] = bin_dir
ENV['PROGNAME'] = prog_name

# Construct a string representing the path to the Erlang executable and
# the arguments given to this script
# (surround each set of args with quotes to handle spaces nicely)
cmd = "\"#{File.join(bin_dir, "erlexec")}\" #{ARGV.map{|s| "\"#{s}\""}.join(" ")}"

# Replace this process with the Erlang BEAM and away we go!
exec cmd
