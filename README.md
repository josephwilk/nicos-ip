# Nicosip

A live-coding language and application based on Sonic Pi's Ruby server.

```
I was once Ruby, but I discovered macros.
I was once Sonic Pi but corruption came.
I am now something else.
```

## Why?

* I can do things Sonic Pi cannot.
* I have syntax Sonic Pi does not support.
* I consider commas to be the source of all evil.
* I'm free from the QT GUI. 
* I'm optimised for brevity.
* I am streamlined for live performance.
* Power over accessiblity.

## Building

```
ruby bin/compile-extensions.rb
```

## Running

Nicosip is a service that expects an editor to connect. Such as Emacs (https://github.com/repl-electric/sonic-pi.el)

```
./nicosip
```
