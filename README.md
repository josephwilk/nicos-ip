# Nicosip

A live-coding language and application based on Sonic Pi's Ruby server.

```
I was once Ruby, but I discovered macros.
I was once Sonic Pi but corruption came.
I am now something else.
```

### Running

Nicosip is a service that expects an editor to connect. Such as Emacs (https://github.com/repl-electric/sonic-pi.el)

```
./nicosip
```
